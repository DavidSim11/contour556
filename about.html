    <h1>What is Contour556</h1>
    <p>Contour 556 is the water level of Lake Burley Griffin, which links the event in name as well as in purpose to the history of the central Canberra landscape.
    <br> The artworks and installations selected for the festival respond in some way to Canberra’s history, from 50,000 years to the present day.
    <br> contour 556 will therefore offer the Canberra, Australian and international community a unique opportunity to engage with and understand the layers of Canberra’s history through art.</p>
